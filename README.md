(Remainder to make sure font doesnt slow everything down)
⚠️ Be careful when using this approach. Make sure your bundler doesn't eager load all the font variations (100/300/400/500/700/900, italic/regular, SVG/woff). Fontsource can be configured to load specific subsets, weights and styles. Inlining all the font files can significantly increase the size of your bundle. Material-UI default typography configuration only relies on 300, 400, 500, and 700 font weights.
